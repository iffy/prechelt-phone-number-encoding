  must be WORD with non-digits removed.  On recursive calls, START is the
  position in DIGITS at which to look for the next word, and WORDS is the list
  of words found for (subseq DIGITS 0 START).  So if START gets to the end of
  DIGITS, then we have a solution in WORDS.  Otherwise, for every prefix of
  DIGITS, look in the dictionary for word(s) that map to the value of the
  prefix (computed incrementally as N), and for each such word try to extend
  the solution with a recursive call.  There are two complications: (1) the
  rules say that in addition to dictionary words, you can use a single
  digit in the output, but not two digits in a row. Also (and this seems
  silly) you can't have a digit in a place where any word could appear.
  I handle this with the variable FOUND-WORD; if it is false after the loop,
  and the most recent word is not a digit, try a recursive call that pushes a
  digit. (2) The other complication is that the obvious way of mapping
  strings to integers would map R to 2 and ER to 02, which of course is
  the same integer as 2.  Therefore we prepend a 1 to every number, and R
  becomes 12 and ER becomes 102."
